# Analysis-of-Single-Cell-RNA-data-h5-using-seurat-package
the project involve the analysis of 20k_PBMC_3p_HT_nextgem_Chromium_X_filtered_feature_bc_matrix (2).h5 using seurat and  seurat standard workflow.
the process typically begins with creating a Seurat object using a read counts matrix. Quality control (QC) is then performed to assess metrics like the number of detected genes and mitochondrial content, followed by filtering out low-quality cells. After QC, normalization is applied to adjust for sequencing depth variations. The Seurat objectâ€™s @commands slot stores the history of commands executed. Next, highly variable features are identified to focus on the most informative genes. The data is then scaled to remove unwanted sources of variation. Understanding the differences between the @counts, @data, and @scale.data slots is crucial as they represent raw counts, normalized data, and scaled data, respectively. Linear dimensionality reduction, typically using PCA, is performed to reduce the data's complexity. The dataset's dimensionality is determined to decide how many principal components to retain. Finally, clustering is carried out to group cells into distinct clusters based on their expression profiles.
